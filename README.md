# From High School Hype to NBA Stardom
### STAT Capstone Project - Isaac Ke

## Introduction
<p>LeBron James. Stephen Curry. What do these household names have in common? Surely, they both have been named the NBA’s Most Valuable Player (MVP) on multiple occasions and have led their teams to numerous world championships. However, only LeBron James was ranked the number one best player coming out of high school. In fact, Steph Curry was unranked by recruiters in high school which meant that he went so unnoticed that he couldn’t even crack the bottom of the list. Is future stardom really that hard to predict? Or was Steph Curry a once-in-a-blue-moon type of phenom?</p>
<p>In this age of social media and video streaming, the hype surrounding top high school and college players can blow-up quite literally in an instant. Hoop mixtapes posted on YouTube or highlight reels circulating around Twitter are just a few of the efficient ways for young athletes to catch the eyes of college or NBA scouts.</p>
<p>But how does a player’s success at the high school or collegiate level impact how they will fair at the professional level? By examining and modeling athletes from their high school basketball days through their NBA career, we can gain an understanding on how a young athlete’s potential translates to future stardom, if at all.</p>

## Importance of Study
<p>A better understanding of how professional success can be predicted based on key high school, collegiate, and advanced NBA statistics will allow recruiters to re-focus their scouting programs to bring in the best athletes to their program while minimizing resource expenditure. Having more “box-office” athletes pass through college programs and NBA team arenas will certainly boost revenue and spur on the overall economy of the city. </p>
<p>Similarly, influential sport companies such as Nike or Adidas will be able to offer endorsement deals to young blossoming athletes with less risk and a higher rate of return. Coaches and NBA executives will be able to sign players to more valuable contracts which would help them build winning franchises that pack the stands with fans.  </p>
<p>Furthermore, we can redefine false stigmas surrounding young athletes, especially those who are discouraged by the seemingly daunting obstacles they face early on in their professional basketball careers.</p>

## Aims
<p>My first aim is to test my hypothesis that a player’s high school rank and draft position have a strong positive association with NBA career longevity. I aim to uncover what the true relationship is between a player’s pre-professional rankings and how many seasons they last in the NBA. </p>
<p>My second aim is to test my related hypothesis that the better a player’s high school rank and draft position are, the higher the player’s maximum level reached will be (draft, rookie, bad, good, great, all-star). My goal is to assess which factors are good predictors of peak performance. </p>
